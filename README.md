# vulkanMC
vulkanMC is an unfinished project whose objective was to demonstrate the capabilites of the Vulkan API vs OpenGL in the 3D reconstruction of objects, by using the popular Marching Cubes algorithm.

The demo showcased a CT Scanned full skull object converted to a point mesh by Marching Cubes and then rendered using Unity 5.6.03f. (In order to run the project it is necessary to install Unity 5.6.03f, clone this repo and uncompress the .rar folders)
